build the image in the dockerfile

Command explanation: 

This command is used to run a Docker container with the Cypress image version 12.9.0. Hereâ€™s what each flag does:

-it: This flag is used to run the container in interactive mode and allocate a pseudo-TTY.
-v %cd%:/e2e: This flag is used to mount the current working directory (represented by %cd%) to the /e2e directory inside the container. This allows you to share files between your host machine and the container.
-w /e2e: This flag is used to set the working directory inside the container to /e2e.
cypress/included:12.9.0: This is the name of the Docker image that you want to run
